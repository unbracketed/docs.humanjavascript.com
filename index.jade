          h2 Introduction
          p 
            | There are lots of toolkits for building single page apps or "Native HTML5 Apps" if you will. It seems they're either too generic and unopinionated or too tightly coupled or require a lot of knowledge and understanding of the framework. After having built lots of single page apps with various tools at 
            a(href="http://andyet.com") &amp;yet 
            | we've surmised that the ideal seems to lie somewhere in the middle.

          p 
            | Ultimately we'd like something that is comprised of lots of independent little tools that each to one thing (see 
            a(href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html") Unix philosophy
            | ).

          p 
            | That said, starting with a group of completely unassembled little pieces is inefficient because there are lots of patterns common to 
            em most  
            | apps. So we need an opinionated starting point.

          p Enter HumanJS. It's not a framework per se, it's a bag of pre-assembled little tools that you're free to rip apart and add to with the following goals in mind.

          h3 Goals

          ul
            li Provides an opinionated starting point for an app
            li Easy to get up and running
            li Minimal framework-specific knowledge required (knowing JavaScript well gets you 95% there)
            li Minimal magic
            li Solve the develpment workflow problems out of the box:
              ul
                li Unminified and re-built automatically in develpment
                li Minfied, cached for production use
                li Switching between the two with a single config flag
            li Use node.js to simplify develpment
            li 100% client rendered
            li Readability
            li App can be served as static content by any server (node.js not required in production)
            li Easy to collaborate on:
              ul 
                li Clear file structure where everything has a logical place
                li Proper seperation of concerns
            li Use npm + browserify for package management but still play nicely with non-common JS libraries.

            li A fully functional development environment that will watch for changes. You just modify and refresh (without manual build steps).
            li Changing one flag in your config puts it in production mode which builds and serves minfied, uniquely named, and permanently cachable static files.
            li A clientside routing system using HTML5 pushState.
            li A main layout template is rendered by the main view that includes a page container where page views are rendered as the user navigates to different URLs in the app.
            li An example of rendering a collection of models in a container.
            li A mock REST API to demonstrate how you might talk to an API to fetch data.
            li 
              | A solution for declaritive binding of model properties to views, that is 
              em completely 
              | decoupled from the template engine. See human-view below for more details.
            li A solution for creating readable, type-checked, and very explicitly defined models. This is hugely important in team enviroments where you need somewhere to reference what is being stored on your models. See human-model for more detail.

          h2(data-nav="moonboots") Moonboots

          p Moonboots is a tool to help you intelligently deal with different goals of serving JS during development and in production.
          p In development we explicitly don't want to cache or minify our JS and CSS files while working. We want to organize our modules in a way that makes the most sense for us as we're building the app.
          p In production, we want to use the exact same source code structure to generate a single minified, uniquely named file for the JS and the CSS so we can tell the browser to cache those permanently. If we do our job correctly when serving those files, our main application code will be downloaded once per revision of the app.
          p Moonboots aims to solve this problem. You structure your entire application in the same way that you would in node with Common JS modules requiring each other. It uses browserify under the hood to do all that magic. But then you just configure your client application like so: 

          h3 Moonboots and Express.js

          p 
            | The full documentation for moonboots is 
            a(href="https://github.com/henrikjoreteg/moonboots#readme") available in the Moonboots repo
            | .

          p For a preview, here's how we'd configure a clientside moonboots app to be served by Express:

          pre
            code.js.
              var express = require('express'),
                  Moonboots = require('moonboots'),
                  app = express();

              // configure our app
              var clientApp = new Moonboots({
                  main: __dirname + '/sample/app/app.js',
                  developmentMode: false,
                  libraries: [
                      __dirname + '/sample/libraries/jquery.js'
                  ],
                  stylesheets: [
                      __dirname + '/styles.css'
                  ],
                  server: app
              });

              // We also just need to specify the routes at which we want to serve this clientside app.
              // This is important for supporting "deep linking" into a single page app. The server
              // has to know what urls to let the browser app handle.
              app.get('*', clientApp.html());

              // start listening for http requests
              app.listen(3000);
